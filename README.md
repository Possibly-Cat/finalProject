Producing Poker for One
 The Project
Poker for One will allow a player to play either texas hold’em or seven card stud against some number of bots. The game will have a betting system allowing both the player and the bots to bet according to the no-limit betting structure. The bots will have rudimentary betting programs, and will try to play the best poker I can make them play. We will need the ArrayList library, and  incorporate others if the need arises.
